# volodb-frontend

VoloDB is an open source project that is intended to massively simplify the administration of the volunteer service formats "FSJ" (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) and "BFD" (Bundesfreiwilligendienst) recognized in Germany.

The project is still in its infancy. We look forward to any support!
